# Container

Containers are the most basic layout element and are required when using our default grid system. Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning itâ€™s 100% wide all the time).

While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

* Use `container` for its max-width to change at each breakpoint.
* Use `container-fluid` for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
