# Grid

## Equal width Columns

Here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport, from `xs` to `xl`.

## One Column Width

You can also just set the width of one column and others will auto adjust.

## All Breakpoints

Just using `.col` or `.col-*` classes means the grid is the same across all devices.

## Stacked To Horizontal

Using a single set of `.col-sm-*` classes, you can create a basic grid system that starts out stacked on extra small devices before becoming horizontal on desktop (small) devices.

## Mix and Match

Donâ€™t want your columns to simply stack in some grid tiers? Use a combination of different classes for each tier as needed. See the example below for a better idea of how it all works.

## Ordering Columns

Use the `.order-*` for controlling the visual order of your content.

## Offsetting Columns

Move columns to the right using `.offset-md-*` classes. These classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns. For example, `.offset-md-4` moves `.col-md-4` over four columns.
